# Wishlist App üéÅ

This is an **in-progress** Angular application that I started as part of a tutorial when I began learning Angular in May. The app is a simple, user-friendly platform designed to manage and organize wishlists.

## About the Project

The **Wishlist App** was my introduction to Angular development. It helped me learn the fundamentals of Angular, such as:
- Component-based architecture
- Data binding
- Dependency injection
- Routing

While it began as a tutorial project, I plan to enhance it with additional features and a polished design as I continue to develop my Angular skills.
